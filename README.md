Found an edge case what my providers are missing?
Have a good idea a topic which is not covered? Feel free to create an issue and I will try to implement it as soon as possible.

#### Side Notes

This module came up based on a sessions IÂ´ve seen at the PowerShell + Devops Global Summit in 2024.

[Justin Grote](https://github.com/JustinGrote) introduces in his session how FeedbackProvider in PowerShell works and he showed his ScriptFeedBackProvider Module.
